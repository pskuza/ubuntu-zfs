# Root login is not allowed for auditing reasons. This is because it's difficult to track which process belongs to which root user:
# On Linux, user sessions are tracking using a kernel-side session id, however, this session id is not recorded by OpenSSH.
# Additionally, only tools such as systemd and auditd record the process session id.
# On other OSes, the user session id is not necessarily recorded at all kernel-side.
# Using regular users in combination with /bin/su or /usr/bin/sudo ensure a clear audit track.
PermitRootLogin No
# Use kernel sandbox mechanisms where possible in unprivilegied processes
# Systrace on OpenBSD, Seccomp on Linux, seatbelt on MacOSX/Darwin, rlimit elsewhere.
UsePrivilegeSeparation sandbox
# If this option is set to “no” (the default) then only addresses and not host names may be used in ~/.ssh/known_hosts from and sshd_config Match Host directives.
UseDNS no
# ets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client.
